    <h3>The story thus far...</h3>
    <p>I only recently (in the past 2-3 years) became interested in computer science as a career choice.</p>
    <p>I was always fascinated with the notion of coding, but it was a mystery how it all worked, until now...</p>
    <p>I decided to use this project as a way to document this next chapter of my life.</p>
